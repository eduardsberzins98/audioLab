# EUEEEsoc Real-Time Audio Effects Workshop
Example/Answer scripts for EUEEEsoc real-time audio effects workshop

Consider these scripts as one possible answers to the tasks given to you in the instructions. Maybe the code you've written looks different but performs the same task or even performs it better! Please don't just copy the code, try to write it yourself and only check these when you're stuck. Copying the code would make the whole workshop redundant.

If you want to have a preview of what the lab is about check out: talkThrough.m (no effects added and just your voice played back in real time) and combined.m (2 different effects added to your voice in real-time).
